/*
 * schema.ts
 *
 * Type definition for Swagger 2.0 schema, decorated with comments from the
 * version 2.0 spec at: http://swagger.io/specification/
 *
 * Names of objects, fields and types are designed to match the specification
 * as consistently as possible.  e.g. the Path Item Object in the spec is defined by
 * PathItem interface.
 *
 * Limitations of type definition:
 * 1) Does not support extensions to the Swagger Schema, e.g. x-internal-id.
 *    Therefore presence in an object literal will result in a compiler error.
 * 2) Format field values are limited to those enumerated in DataFormat type.
 *    The spec allows for any string.
 * 3) ONLY SUPPORTS 2.0 SCHEMA.
